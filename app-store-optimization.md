## üöÄ Implement App Store Algorithm Updates (June 2024)

### Context
Apple made significant changes to the App Store ranking algorithm that affect app discovery and rankings. These changes require immediate action to maintain/improve our app's visibility.

### Problem
1. **New App Boost Removed**: Our app will no longer receive automatic ranking boost when published (takes ~13 days to start ranking organically)
2. **Screenshots Impact Rankings**: Apple now uses OCR/AI to extract text from screenshots as keyword metadata

### Required Changes

#### üì∏ Screenshot Optimization
- [ ] Audit current screenshots for keyword opportunities
- [ ] Replace passive phrases with active keywords
  - ‚ùå "Easy to Use"
  - ‚úÖ "Track Sleep Patterns" / "Monitor Heart Rate" / [specific features]
- [ ] Ensure text has high contrast and is machine-readable
- [ ] Add relevant keywords to screenshot captions that make sense to users
- [ ] Test screenshots across all supported device sizes

#### üîç Keyword Strategy
- [ ] Research competitor screenshots for keyword ideas
- [ ] Identify primary keywords for each core feature
- [ ] Map keywords to specific screenshots
- [ ] Ensure keywords appear naturally in context

### Technical Requirements
- Clear, high-contrast text (for OCR readability)
- Relevant keywords that match app functionality
- Consistent keyword usage across localized versions

### Success Metrics
- Improved keyword rankings within 30 days
- Increased organic discovery through search
- Higher conversion rate from screenshot improvements
